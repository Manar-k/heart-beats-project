Designed and implemented an application in 3-person team using Java, JavaFX, and Mysql Workbench.





This application enable user to:

• login.

• connect airpods to wireless medical drum via bluetooth.

• display heart rate info.




 Project Idea:
 
 The idea is an application that allows the user (the doctor) when logging in to the application to pair via Bluetooth with the wireless headset and the medical drum, where he can measure heart rates, and within the application, an interface appears to the user as a result and reads the patient’s heart rate, and an interface to show the status of the Bluetooth connection.
