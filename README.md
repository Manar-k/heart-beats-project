 The idea is an application that allows the user (the doctor) when logging in to the application to pair via Bluetooth with the wireless headset and the medical drum, where he can measure heart rates, and within the application, an interface appears to the user as a result and reads the patientâ€™s heart rate, and an interface to show the status of the Bluetooth connection.
